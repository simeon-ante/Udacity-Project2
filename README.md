## Data wrangling and analysis with python.

Real-world data rarely comes clean. In this project, I used Python and its libraries, to gather data
from three sources and in three different formats. I assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned
it.

I followed three steps in the wrangling process which are: 

1. Gather data 
2. Assess data 
3. Clean data

All the files and notebooks used for this project were uploaded to this repository.
Have fun going through it!!
